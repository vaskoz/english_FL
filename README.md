What if you randomly shuffled the letters between the first and last in the English language. How hard would it be to descramble it while reading?

# It's pretty easy, but why?

There are some assumptions in this problem:

1. Only grammatically and logically correct English sentences are allowed.
2. The words used in those sentence require the following:
    1. The first and last letter of the word are in their correct positions.
    2. There are no substitution errors (typos) for any letters.
    3. There are no addition or removal of letters in the word.

## Okay, but why is it easy?

There aren't that many choices for possible words that meet these constraints. I wrote a program to show that **at most 4 words** could be candidates for these scrambled words.
