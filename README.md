What if you randomly shuffled the letters between the first and last in the English language. How hard would it be to descramble it while reading?

# It's pretty easy, but why?

There are some assumptions in this problem:

1. Only grammatically and logically correct English sentences are allowed.
2. The words used in those sentence require the following:
    1. The first and last letter of the word are in their correct positions.
    2. There are no substitution errors (typos) for any letters.
    3. There are no addition or removal of letters in the word.

# A program to demonstrate that there aren't many possibilities with these constraints.

# Picture of example text
